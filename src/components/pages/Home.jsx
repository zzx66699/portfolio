                            <p>
                                After completing my Master's in Singapore, I joined a fast-paced MedTech startup. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I started with managing social ads and data tracking, but soon I found my flow state in the <span className="text-highlight">the technical details.</span> While others focused on copywriting, I was diving into Shopify to tweak landing pages and troubleshooting pixel tracking. I realized that I truly loved the <span class="text-highlight">tangible act of building the interfaces</span>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I knew that to become the developer I wanted to be, I needed to commit 100%. When I discovered the Netherlands' Search Year Visa, I saw it as the perfect window to pivot my career and immerse myself in technology. So here I am - learning, building, and ready for the next challenge.
